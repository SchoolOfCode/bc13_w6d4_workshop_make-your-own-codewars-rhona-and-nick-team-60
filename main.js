/* 
You've just bought a new house and the bathroom needs renovating urgently. You need to tile one wall completely (floor to ceiling and side to side). You are on a budget and can only afford to buy exactly the right amount of tiles. How many do you need?
x = length of wall
y = height of wall
a = length of tile
b = height of tile
Walls and tiles should always be greater than zero in any given dimension - if any dimension is zero or a negative number, there must have been a measurement error, so return null.
You should return a whole number of tiles with no decimal point.
For anyone that has done some real life tiling, don't worry about grout joints in your calculation!
